# OIBSIP_TASK_2_BMI_CALCULATOR
As part of Task 2 in my internship with OASIS InfoByte, I developed a BMI Calculator App using Python and Tkinter. The app calculates Body Mass Index based on user input of height and weight, and classifies the result as Underweight, Normal, or Overweight. It features a clean GUI, instant results, and promotes health awareness through technology.
